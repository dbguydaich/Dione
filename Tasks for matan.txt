we need a function:
List<String> get_genres()
which will return all genres from database.



we need:
1. a function which will return the genres we have. Make sure it will be constant let's say, ordered alphabetical.
			
db_queries.does_movie_exists(String title,String director,List<String> actor_list,List<String> tags_list,
						List<Boolean>	rating_radios_text,List<Boolean>genres_numbers)}

it will search the movie, acording to title, director, actor list (may be empty), tags_list (may be empty), 
rating numbers (length 5, the rating will be the place which there is a true, genres_numbers - the same, the places will have true. (the same genres form previous task). :) contact me for more details if needed it's 3:00 am...zzzzzzzzz
