InnoDB vs MyISAM 	
	MyISAM		- used on tables with no foreign keys, when more SELECTs (then INSERTs and UPDATEs) are performed on the table
	InnoDB		- used otherwise			

CHAR vs VARCHAR vs NVARCHAR
	NVARCHAR	- no unicode, so no nvarchar
	CHAR		- where words are not very long (<= 24) we used char to get better query speed (with low space cost)
	VARCHAR		- otherwise, to save space.
	
DATE and TIME
	DATETIME	- the only date type used, seemingly the simplest type for usage with java
	
Redundancy issues
	actors		- some persons are actors but not all of them. To get an easy way to enforce constraints their personIDs are duplicated to the 'actor' table
	directors	- same issue as with actors 
	tag N genre	- some but not all of the genres are also tags but they have different duties and come from different sources
