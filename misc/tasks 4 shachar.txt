Dear Shachar,
	Use the function get_top_rated_movies(Integer limit)
	
	When updating movie-rates and tag-rates you are showing false-errors
	
	On user created message place a space after the user name :)
	
	Activities are running out of the screen (Avital)
	
	When signing up with short password write an informative message 
	
	Use all search options in the movie search

	After first rating a movie - nothing happends tough the rate gets in the DB
	
	Use db_operations.fill_user_prefence()

	Crash on Login when empty DB

	
	shahar's addition:
		please make sure you limit the result of every query that returns a "list of something"

		do not create a new display without telling me about it

		search movie: be ready to support a language and year(from - to)


When finished tell me to re run checks and fix more of my bugs...
regards ;)
