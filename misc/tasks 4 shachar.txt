Dear Shachar,
	-----Use the function get_top_rated_movies(Integer limit)

		shahar please check whether real time movies are the good ones.
	
	-------When updating movie-rates and tag-rates you are showing false-errors
	
	----On user created message place a space after the user name :)
	
	Activities are running out of the screen (Avital)
	
	----When signing up with short password write an informative message 
	
	Use all search options in the movie search

	-----After first rating a movie - nothing happends tough the rate gets in the DB
	
	Use db_operations.fill_user_prefence()

	Crash on Login when empty DB


	shahar please implement year in search. search for your name - i need you to cloese windows and go to log in in 	preferences

	
	shahar's addition:
		please make sure you limit the result of every query that returns a "list of something"

		do not create a new display without telling me about it

		search movie:  support language and year(from - until) - neccesary textboxs has been added
				also make sure you search by genres (it seems you dont...)                          

		overview tab: make sure "your recent activities" are general activities (i.e rate movies, tags, and social activities - all mixed up!)

		

When finished tell me to re run checks and fix more of my bugs...
regards ;)
