Dear Shachar,
	-----Use the function get_top_rated_movies(Integer limit)

		shahar please check whether real time movies are the good ones.
	
	-------When updating movie-rates and tag-rates you are showing false-errors
	
	----On user created message place a space after the user name :)
	
	----When signing up with short password write an informative message 
	
	-----Use all search options in the movie search

	-----After first rating a movie - nothing happends tough the rate gets in the DB
	
	Use db_operations.fill_user_prefence()

	-----Crash on Login when empty DB
		avital please check why mimimazied: after log in find that there are no movies to show, it does open the 
		overview window but it s minimized...

	
	shahar's addition:
		please make sure you limit the result of every query that returns a "list of something"

		do not create a new display without telling me about it

Added tasks 04/06/2014
	delete the datsk you have finished from this document
	
	limit the password on change password on settings tab
	
	Hook "Rate Random Movies" button

	When rating a movie through the movie page you get an error though the movie rate is inserted to the DB

	shahar's addition:
		when main starts, if it is the first run - open import data window
		 (i did it, just add the function that checks if it is the first run, and uncomment it)
		
		close background thread (resources: first close shell, then display) when the app is exiting.

		import data button in settings tab - i've already implemented the listener

		look all over the gui for : "//shachar:"
		
When finished tell me to re run checks and fix more of my bugs...
regards ;)
