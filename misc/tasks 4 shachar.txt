Dear Shachar,
	Use the function get_top_rated_movies(Integer limit)

	On social_tab.java you are referring to get_my_name as static which it is not
	
	When updating movie-rates and tag-rates you are showing false-errors
	
	On user created message place a space after the user name :)
	
	Activities are running out of the screen
	
	When signing up with short password write an informative message 
	

When finished tell me to re run checks and fix more of my bugs...
regards ;)
